# 🤖 Bar Elisha's AI Portfolio

Welcome to my **AI Playground**, a public portfolio highlighting some of the innovative and technical projects I've built using Python, Flask, AI models, and data visualization tools.

This repository powers my GitHub Pages website, where each project is briefly showcased. For select private repositories (such as Ballgorithm and HRise), summary documents are available, and full access can be granted upon request.
